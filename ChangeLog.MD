# Change Log

## Unreleased

## [2.0.0] - ????

## Fixed
- +/- operators on vector reverse iterators were incorrectly implemented in v1.

## Changed
- Changed location of GFTLConfig.cmake

    Now installed in a more conventional location:
    ```./lib/cmake/GFTL/GFTLConfig.cmake```
    Previous location was really a windows convention (first attempt).
    Also now using
      . ```configure_package_config_file()
      . ```write_basic_package_version_file()```

- Moved ./cmake_utils to ./cmake
- Relocated config related files to ./cmake
- Added namespace ```gFTL::``` for externa project use  
- Cleaned up CMake logic in include dirs.
- Only search for testing if Fortran compiler is detected.  gFTL does
  not require a Fortran compiler for installation, but Fortran is
  required to build the tests.  Previously, gFTL artificially included
  Fortran in the project LANGUAGES option to sidestep the issue.
- Moved legacy include to include-v1
- Changed capitalization of installation from GFTL to gFTL.
  Users should now use ```find_package(gFTL)```
- Vector template
  . relational operators are module procedures rather than class methods
  . arithmetic operators are module procedures rathen than class methods
  . introduced a few iterator module procedures: advance, begin, distance, end, next, previous

## Added
- Support for type names.

  This is to allow useful diagnostics via DTIO.
  

## [1.2.5] - 2020-04-06

### Fixed

## [1.2.4] -  2019-12-19

  - removed incorrect parens in conditionl
  - added Fortran to PROJECT - necessary for recent change in pFUnit.

## [1.2.3] -  2020-01-06
- Workaround for PGI compiler - does not like "set" as a derived type name.

## [1.2.2] - 2019-11-15
- bugfix for workaround in v1.2.1; some use cases were not
  deallocating structure components prior to reallocation.
	
## [1.2.1] - 2019-11-07
- added workaround for memory leak detected with Intel 18 compiler

## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-01
- updated to use pFUnit 4.0 for tests
